# DLA Visualisation with Unity
 Diffusion Limited Aggregation is a pattern often found in nature, and this is a set of visualisations of this pattern.

3 visualization methods enforcing the 3 principles of realization:

- Engaged visualization
- Multimodality
- Juxtaposition

The code of the generator script is based off my own implementation in Python 5 years ago.
